Introduction

In this course, we’re picking up where CS50 left off and diving into the design and creation of web applications. We’ll build our web-design skills by working on a number of projects throughout the course, including an open-ended final project where you’ll have the chance to create a website of your own!

In this course, you’ll need a text editor where you can write code locally on your computer. Some popular ones include Visual Studios Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and Vim, but there are many more to choose from!

Web Programming
Course Topics: We’ll go into more detail later, but here’s a brief overview of what we’ll be working on during this course:

- HTML and CSS (a markup language used to outline a webpage, and a procedure for making our sites more visually appealing)

- Git (used for version control and collaboration)

- Python (a widely-used programming language we’ll use to make our sites more dynamic)

- Django (a popular web framework we’ll use for the backend of our sites)

- SQL, Models, and Migrations (a language used for storing and retrieving data, and Django-specific methods that make it easier to interact with SQL databases)

- JavaScript (a programming language used to make websites faster and more interactive)

- User Interfaces (methods used to make a website as easy to use as possible)

- Testing, CI, CD (learning about different methods used to make sure updates to web pages proceed smoothly)

- Scalability and Security (making sure our websites can be accessed by many users at once, and that they are safe from malicious intent)
